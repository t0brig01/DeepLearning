- Create a simple model for binary classification.

- To the provided dataset apply:

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿  - Random Under-sampling  
  - Random Over-Sampling
  - Under-sampling: Tomek links
  - Under-sampling: Cluster Centroids
  - Over-sampling: SMOTE
  - Over-sampling->Under-sampling: SMOTE-Tomek

Requirements (Grading Criteria):
-  For each of the cases produce a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model (one model for all the cases) and compare the results obtained by the different techniques in one graph. 
- Please take into account that each of the techniques should be applied to the original data, is not a sequential process. 

- Use 80% of the data to train 20% for testing
- Briefly describe in the comparison of the techniques why you obtained the difference in the performance and why you believe your best model was the best.
